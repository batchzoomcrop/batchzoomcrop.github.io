# BatchZoomCrop Studio

This is an image cropping tool that prioritizes meeting the crop box size by scaling the image to select the cropping area. It integrates image size cropping and proportional image resizing functions. 

When you want to crop an image to a fixed size of 1440×900, but the area you wish to crop in the image is only 1300×800, this would result in cropping areas you do not intend to include. However, with this tool, we can enlarge the image so that the desired cropping area increases from 1300×800 to fill the required cropping area of 1440×900.

Conversely, when the cropping requirement is for a size of 2880×1800, but our cropping area can only be 1440×900 (any larger exceeds the image size), we can set the cropping size to 1440×900 and then configure the tool to double the image size upon export.

The tool comes with built-in sizes for device screenshots required for publishing apps on the App Store and also supports customizing any cropping size as needed.
